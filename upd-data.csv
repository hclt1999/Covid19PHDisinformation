Basically you would have to be brain dead already to submit - but judging from the number of people willingly restricting their oxygen intake, I'd say there are already MANY who will and are offering themselves up for this invasive PROCEDURE - because it's NOT a test for Covid., IT doesn't exist! We are ""testing"" for 2 things, - your submission to willingly have your body violated and for the pretense of finding fragments of previous cold remnants. NOT for Covid 19. This assault is dangerous! This information comes from my colleague doctors. Brain access, is through the nose. The test has another purpose than what the drug pushers say! Inserting a test bar deeply into the nose, causes haematoencephal barrier damage and can also damage endocrine glands (e.g. hypophysis). That's why testing hurts so much! The purpose of this deep violation, is to break the barrier and create an entry into the brain for every infection. When wearing a mouth and nose mask, bacteria and CO2 mask are collected and transported to the brain through the nose channel. Barrier's task is to protect from brain neurotoxins, heavy metals, bacteria and other toxins. If endocrine glands are damaged, symptoms such as muscle weakness, blood circulation, visual disturbances etc. may develop. There is no legal basis for this physical intervention and it is a mass violation of physical immunity! Wake up to the assault. YOU are being violated along with your rights, No wonder so many ""covid survivors"" have long term issues. Anyone would after being subjected to this most sensitive body violation! Anyone who would submit to this needs to wake UP!",https://www.facebook.com/maui.harrison/posts/684690228809785,Image

Instead, it will only uplift the egos of those who rule. And enrich favored contractors. BECAUSE INSTEAD of investing in the development of agriculture and building factories, building the P3.5B Sports Center to house our national athletes was a very bad idea from the very start, that aside from being located in the southernmost end of the country and therefore not strategically located (for the various national athletes to go to train), it is a duplication of the newly-built sports facilities in Clark which the national government built at a cost of P3B-P6B in hosting the last SEA GAMES. CONSTRUCTION OF THE VARIOUS facilities in the said Sports Center started in 2018 but up to now remain uncompleted and abandoned. Look at the tall cogon grasses- they are about to cover the abandoned buildings‼️ PACQUIAO authored Republic Act 11224 otherwise known as an Act establishing the Sarangani Sports Training Center in the Municipality of Alabel, Sarangani Province.

The 10 billion dollar question: what happened to the gold of our ancestors that has been transferred under the custody of Marcos Family?

Gold for gold. Find the gold. Share the gold. Philippine Islands are “Riches Country in the World!” There are 950,000 metric tons of gold ( declared missing in the International Court of Justice in Hague) picked up by Yamashita from its European Ally, Hitler and another 250,000 metric tons of the Japanese loot around Southeast Asia are both now in the Philippines. Very few Filipinos knows this( Wall Street Journal, November 15,1985 issue wrote: “ Two Thirds of all the gold in the world is in Philippines and One third is divided among the rest of the countries of the world”) ; During A TALK SHOW in a U.S. TV , the week following the bombing of the New York Twin Towers, President George Bush was asked this question: Which is the richest country in the world today? With a smile he said; “The Philippines.” In a US TV interview as well with President Barrack Obama, in his “700 Billion USD stimulus funds” for US economy, he was asked a question where will he get the billion dollar substantial funds needed and quoted saying. “We have friends outside US who will support us”.
The branded Yamashita Treasure was considered “booty”. There were varied country claimants who are victims of the said WWII loots and these countries filed protest and claims after the war in the International Court of Justice. Though, there was a passage of law for thirty years starting 1946, that without a valid claim against it this “booty” it would belong to its new possessor. That would have been in 1976. However, the International Criminal Court (ICC) extended the deadline of the claims to 10 years up to 1986. With the conspiracy of the International Banking Cartel, neither the ICJ denied the existence of these gold and claims. Sadly, Successive governments of the Philippines denied its existence and failed to acknowledged the gold. For almost 24 years, Information has been conspired to keep from being known to Filipino people.",WORLD BANK TOP 10 COUNTRIES WITH HIGHEST GOLD RESERVES! PHILIPPINES LANDED NUMBER ONE?,Article

Sa USA halos 90% ng negosyo ay micro, pero dito sa atin baliktad na kaya bibihira lang na umaasenso ang mga maliliit na negosyo kasi kinakain lang ito ng mga higanteng korporasyon. Tingnan nyo ang Ilocos Norte priority nila ang mga magsasaka at maliliit na negosyante kaya di basta basta sila pumapayag matayo ng mga Malls sa lugar nila kasi madaming mawawalan ng hanapbuhay tulad ng mga sarisari store at iba pang mga livelihood. Iniiwasan nila ang monopolyo ng malalaking negosyante. Noong panahon ni marcos meron kadiwa store kaya walang laban ang mga malls. KADIWA Former First Lady Imelda Marcos created the KADIWA for our poor people to buy their basic needs. The main purpose of this project is to bring down prices of basic consumer’s goods such as food, by establishing KADIWA Centers and KADIWA Rolling Stores for the most depressed areas in Metro Manila to service the very poor. Bringing cheaper food to the poor family’s door steps hoping to eliminate transportation expenses. She established the KADIWA chains of stores all over the country to create a sure market for farmers’ produce. The KADIWA was not meant to ease out the privately-owned groceries and food retailers but for the government to stabilize, if not reduce, the prices of basic commodities. To ensure that the KADIWA and other retailers would be able to sell their goods to our people at the lowest price, Imelda urged President Marcos to create the Greater Manila Terminal Food Market, Inc. (GMTFMI) in Taguig or more popularly known as FTI. The food terminal sought to provide the basic commodities at subsidized prices to the various KADIWA outlets and private groceries located mostly in Metro Manila. It has storage facilities, food processing center, a centrally refrigerated warehouse complete with chilling rooms, freezer storage, ice plant, blast freezers and refrigerated processing rooms. It has a slaughterhouse, a chicken dressing plant, dry storage and packaging facilities for our export products. About 252 KADIWA centers were established but were sadly ransacked and vandalized after the 1986 EDSA Revolution until it was ordered closed at the instigation of big business. The KADIWA project was abolished by the Cory Aquino government and its vast property in Taguig was sold to the Ayala Group of Companies.",PSSAP MEDIA - Noong panahon ni dating pangulong Marcos ay... | Facebook,Image
